This repository contains code for test version of holographic pyramid.
To use this application it needs to have LeapMotion device, which is infrared sensor with function of hands tracking.

The idea of this poject is using the horisontal display, on which there is a pyramid of transparent material.
Looking on this pyramid from sides allow you to see a hologram of the object whose model is loaded into the program.
